                <h2>Why is it my favourite movie?</h2>

                    <p2>Who knows ey, for some reason 70's music clothing and all in all attitude just speaks to this lad.
                    <br> I saw this music for the first time at around the age of 15 just about when I got my first record player and got into spending my pocket money on vinyls. 
                    <br> I remember watching it due to a site online recommending it as a comperatively good movie to the show freaks and geeks.
                    <br>I put it on on my laptop and right after watching it for the first time I just put it on again, something I'd never done before and have never done since.

                    <p3>I must have watch Dazed and confused a total of 70 times by now and can quite confidently quote most of it woith voices and all. 
                    one of the big reasons I just keep putting the movie on is the sound track, which I too have on vinyl. <br>It's a perect list of mainstream 70's rock from Bob Dylan's Hurricane to Dr. John's right place wrong time. 
                    The Movie is recognised these days mainly for it being the first appearance of Matthew McConaughey in an acting roll. <br> With that also being the first time he ever says his most famous line ever, "alright alright alright"
